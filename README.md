<!-- ## Micro Meta App -->

**_Micro Meta App_ is an open, easy to use, and powerful software platform to capture and manage Microscopy metadata on the basis of the [4DN-BINA extension](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11370) of the [OME data model](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/ome-model/6.1.1/developers/model-overview.html).**

----

## The current version is beta v0.0.22!

This is a *beta* release and the source code is [available here](https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/4DNMicroscopyMetadataToolReact).

If you want to use it and help us testing it please contact: caterina.strambio@umassmed.edu.

<!-- See the [changelog]() for more details. -->


## Micro-Meta App beta v0.0.26 is coming soon!

**Tovards the next beta version**.

More than six months since v0.0.22 and *a lot* is being changed. <br/>
Highlights include:
* Icons snap in place ([link]())
* Updated [data model]() including several new hardware components ([link]())
* Several bug fixes ([link]())

Find the full documentation [here](https://micrometaapp-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

> **Important!** It is not recommended to mix different version of Micro Meta App for working on Microcope files. If you started a project in v0.0.22, it is probably best to continue with that version - or even better start again with the latest version.
