**_Micro Meta App_ is an open, easy to use, and powerful software platform to capture and manage Microscopy metadata on the basis of the [4DN-BINA extension](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11370) of the [OME data model](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/ome-model/6.1.1/developers/model-overview.html).**

----

## The current version is v0.0.0a28!

This is an *alpha* release and the source code is [available here](https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/4DNMicroscopyMetadataToolReact).

If you want to use it and help us testing it please contact: caterina.strambio@umassmed.edu.

<!-- See the [changelog]() for more details. -->

This version fixes several bugs and introduces Icon snap-in-place Highlights include:

## Micro-Meta App beta v0.1.0b00 is coming soon!

**Tovards the first beta version**.
The major changes in the upcoming version will include the incorporation of v02.00 of the 4DN-BINA Microscopy Metadata guidelines
* Updated [data model](https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/MicroscopyMetadata4DNGuidelines/tree/master/Model/in%20progress/v02-00) including several new hardware components ([link](https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/MicroscopyMetadata4DNGuidelines/blob/master/Model/in%20progress/v02-00/4DN-BINA-OME-Microscopy%20Metadata_ER%20diagram_CORE%2BBASIC.jpg))

> **Important!** It is not recommended to mix different version of Micro Meta App for working on Microcope files. If you started a project in v0.0.22, it is probably best to continue with that version - or even better start again with the latest version.
